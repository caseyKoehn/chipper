Chipper Raspberry Pi Headless Setup
Update: You no longer need this if using the Raspberry Pi Imager software as it now has this capability.
This program is a Python GUI interface that makes setting up an SD card for a headless SSH Raspberry Pi Startup a breeze. Should work with most operating systems (only tried a few) that support SSH and will work on all versions of the Pi (except Pico of course).
